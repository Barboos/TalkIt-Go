## Database Setup

The first thing you need to do is open up the "database.yml" file and edit it to use the correct usernames, passwords, hosts, etc... that are appropriate for your environment.

You will also need to make sure that **you** start/install the database of your choice.

### Create Your Databases

Ok, so you've edited the "database.yml" file and started your database, now use:

	$ buffalo pop create -a

## Starting the Application

To run the application use:

	$ buffalo dev

**Congratulations!** You now have your Buffalo application up and running.
